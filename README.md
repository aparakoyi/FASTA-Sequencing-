# FASTA Sequencing for GC%, Protein and Secondary Structure Count
## Abigail Parakoyi 

# Overview 
This project focused on calculating the nucleotide statistics for the specified influenza FASTA file as well as getting the number of protein and secondary structures from the FASTA file. 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies 
* Ran on MAC OS
* Python Version 3.10
  
### Installing 
Both sequencing codes **nt_fasta_stats.py** and **Secondary_structure_splitter.py** are run from the command line. Ensure that the following data files are downloaded and placed into your working directory, they can be found within the FASTA Files folder in this repository:
* Influneza.fasta
* pbd_protein.fasta
* pbd_ss.fasta
  
### Executing Program 
To run **nt_fasta_stats.py** and **Secondary_structure_splitter.py** in the terminal within the folder where the files are downloaded simply run the following lines: 
```
nt_fasta_stats.py
Secondary_structure_splitter.py
```
Once both programs are executed two output files will be produced:
* Influenza.stats.txt
* ss.txt
